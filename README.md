# FSO-HAPS-Communication-System-Analysis-
- Performed performance and capacity analysis for dual-hop asymmetric FSO systems, addressing path loss, turbulence, and pointing errors through decode-and-forward protocols.
- Derived closed-form mathematical models and simulations for outage probability, bit error rate, and channel capacity using Gamma-Gamma turbulence models.
- Optimized hybrid FSO systems with High Altitude Platform Stations (HAPS), significantly improving signal quality, SNR, and system resilience in varied atmospheric conditions.
